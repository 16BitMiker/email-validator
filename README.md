# E-mail Validator

Validate those e-mails with regex! (Not perfect but a start). This is a modified version of my [reddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/regex/comments/otd9py/reasonable_email_validation_with_regex/) / [regex101](https://regex101.com/r/0fMpfy/1) post I made awhile back.

## Featuring

- Free space mode for clean organized regex action
- Regex grammers for resuable patterns
- Positive and negative lookarounds to do the dirty work

## To Do

- Refractor for even more use cases!
- Add more methods to injest e-mails (csv, json, newline delimited)
